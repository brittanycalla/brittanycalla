### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brittany. I'm a data analyst with a creative mindset for analyzing and interpreting complex datasets and translating them into valuable insights. I draw on my background in the visual arts to build engaging visualizations and communications. I'm known for asking insightful questions and learning quickly (I can figure anything out!).

I'm excited about opportunities to combine my visual arts and data analysis skills to transform data into meaningful discoveries and share insights that have a real impact on clients, organizations, and communities.
