### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brittany. Iâ€™m a creative software engineer passionate about building beautiful and intuitive full stack web applications. As a former visual artist, I bring a different perspective to tech - I want to create software that users want to come back to again and again. I'm known for asking insightful questions and learning quickly. Iâ€™m passionate about tapping into the power of technology to make a meaningful impact for clients, organizations, and communities.

Want to work together or chat about data, programming, or community building?<br>ðŸ“« Let's talk!: [brittany@brittanycallahan.com](mailto:brittany@brittanycallahan.com)
